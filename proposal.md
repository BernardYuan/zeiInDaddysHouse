Introduction (Motivation)
-----------------------

Most of current music softwares (Spotify, Deezer, Pandora, etc.) don't allow users to upload their own music. Instead, the servers unidirectionally provide music to users.<br>
Our music sharing website, however, aims to provide a music sharing platform for users grouped by common interest. Within a interest group, users can upload their own music and share with others the music as well as their opinions towards the music to other members in the group.

Project Summary
-----------------------
This project is an online web music sharing system based on group sharing, which allows users to create groups and upload and share music to group members. Also,  with a registered account, users can create their own online play lists and listen to music provided in the groups. Concerning the copyright of music, the usage of this web system is only limited to listening online without saving to local.
