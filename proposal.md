Introduction (Motivation)
-----------------------

Most of current music softwares (Spotify, Deezer, Pandora, etc.) don't allow users to upload their own music, thus, their music stock is very limited. Though music software companies intend to enrich their music database, many unpopular but great songs or music are still unavaible. To allow users to upload and recommend music is a powerful way to include a rich bank of music.

Project Summary
-----------------------
This project is an online web music sharing system, which allows users to upload and share music. With a registered account, users can create online play list and listen to music. Concerning the copyright of music, the usage of this web system is only limited to listening online without saving to local.
